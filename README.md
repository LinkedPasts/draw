A pilot application for digitizing features from georeferenced historical maps.

This work-in-progress is a proof of concept tool for use by individuals and small groups in "historical mapathons." It is a side project of [World Historical Gazetteer](http://dev.whgazetteer.org) In time, we hope to see a tool for crowdsourcing this kind of work follow, with many more features. This will require funding and/or volunteer development effort.
